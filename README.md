# Coding style guides for GyazSquare

## Introduction

Style guides include the guidelines for the standard coding that engineers should follow. This project holds the guidelines we use for GyazSquare code.

Style guides are important to engineers for a number of reasons:

* 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.
* Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.
* Style guides improve the readability of the source code, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.

## Style Guides

* Objective-C ([Japanese](objective-c.ja.md))
